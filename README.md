# Welcome to my RGB-Wifi Controller Project!

## Introduction

This is one of my personal projects working with Microcontrollers. This project uses a local server as a user interface to control an LED strip. This includes the ability to change RGB values, master brightness, and some basic animations. More features to come.

## Current Features

* Change RGB values for a section of LEDs
* Change the master brightness of LEDs
* Basic animation to 'move' the LEDs up and down the strip.
